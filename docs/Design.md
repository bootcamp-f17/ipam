# Design

1. This should be a responsive website

Yes, responsive.

Does not expect to do editing on a phone. Primarily this will be for fast lookup.

2. For the homepage (where users land after login), perhaps a tabbed view will reduce number of clicks. Initial thoughts...

  Two tabs: Sites, Subnets - add Equipment

  Each tab shows a sortable grid

  It's essentially the same data, just presented from two different groupings


Bootstrap color scheme okay

There are 7 sites. New sites are NOT created frequently. Or ever.

Adding a subnet can only be done when a site is selected.

In the sites tab, click on a site to expand and show a list of the site's subnets.

Equipment belongs to a subnet.

Subnets belong to sites.

Add equipment tab to dashboard.

Being able to filter as well as sort by clicking column heads would be HUGE.

Much of Ray's design requirements come from looking at spreadsheets. :-)

Predicting collisions is important re: addressing.

Equipment belongs to a single subnet
Subnet belongs to a single site

View is 75% of the usage, edit is 25%

When a subnet is created, allow for autoassignment of equipment that falls in its IP range

Can we have movable columns? Okay if this only works for current session, not persistent

Easter eggs? :-)
