1. This should be a responsive website

2. For the homepage (where users land after login), perhaps a tabbed view will reduce number of clicks. Initial thoughts...

  Two tabs: Sites, Subnets

  Each tab shows a sortable grid

  It's essentially the same date, just presented from two different groupings
